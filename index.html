					They expect you to analysis and browse severally. you'll browse books, online journal articles or
					analysis on the net. this can be referred to as wide reading. after you write tutorial assignments,
					you need to demonstrate your wide reading by citing ideas or concepts from this wide reading.
					Citations are academics’ means of showing that they're victimization somebody else’s ideas,
					concepts, theories or actual words. Plagiarism is that the presentation of the ideas and words
					of another author, artist, film maker etcetera as you own with none sort of acknowledgement.
